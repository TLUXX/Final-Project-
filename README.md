Share a rough idea for a final web programming project that will stretch out over multiple weeks. Your instructor will give you some feedback to help shape it, so don't worry about having every detail clear. Just describe, conversationally, what you're interested in making and why. Plan for your project to include a substantial Javascript component, since that will be the main focus of the evaluation.
Consider the following:
•	What kind of data would be needed? If you need to save data, look at the data store API we're providing. You might also need data from other sources.
•	Describe your idea from the Outside-In with a few user stories. Who are the users? What do they want to accomplish? How should it work?
•	Describe your idea from the Inside-Out. What type of technology is needed to make it work?
As an example, you might write a single-page application where you provide details about events you're planning to attend and what the predicted weather is at those occuring in the next week. You'd have a "coming up soon" block on the page with the near-future events and their forecasts. There'd be a form to add new events, and some way to edit and delete existing events.
Another might be to create an artist page for yourself that links out to songs you've written or performed. Create one single-page application for administrators, to create, update, delete, and perhaps re-order songs. A second SPA would be the public view, requesting the data and formatting it nicely. Give users a way to comment or like specific songs, and view the comments of others. Maybe include a way to sort by number of likes.
Comment on at least one other student's work with feedback, ideas, or questions about the project.
You'll have plenty of opportunity to refine or modify this idea over the next few weeks. The goal is not to overcommit, but to take an idea and go through the exercise of fleshing it out and describing it as something that could be turned into real code.


For my final project, I would like to create single artist page that will help people learn a bit more about my music and myself.  (TLUXX)

Users: My audience would be people who enjoy Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and attend music festivals.

I started this in the html exercise we had in week 6.  

The site will include Buttons for;  A bio,  upcoming shows, articles, and a music shop. 
Each button will take the user to an area where they can get information about the artist. 

The main part of the page will be giving people access to all the music I have released.  This part will be the Javascript portion of the site. Kind of like the Album store we created in week 6.  Maybe allow people to make comment and rate songs. 

It would be nice to have an area where people can subscribe to my page with their email address, so I would be able to notify them of upcoming shows and releases.
